üèÜ RAG Evaluation:

Criteria: Context Relevance

Verdict: Score.high_relevance

Reasoning: The retrieved context provides a clear and detailed description of LangGraph, including its purpose, architecture, and key features. This directly aligns with the user's query about what LangGraph is, making the context highly relevant.

Score: 3/3

Criteria: Answer Relevance

Verdict: Score.medium_relevance

Reasoning: The generated answer accurately describes LangGraph as a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs and mentions its foundation on LangChain. However, it introduces the term 'finite state machine approach' without context or explanation, which may confuse the user. Overall, it is mostly relevant but slightly less comprehensive than the context.

Score: 2/3

Criteria: Groundedness

Verdict: Score.medium_relevance

Reasoning: The generated answer is mostly grounded in the retrieved context, as it correctly identifies LangGraph's purpose and its relationship with LangChain. However, the mention of a 'finite state machine approach' is not supported by the retrieved context, which could mislead the user. Therefore, while the answer is largely faithful to the context, the additional term detracts from its groundedness.

Score: 2/3
