üèÜ RAG Evaluation:

Criteria: Context Relevance

Reasoning: The retrieved context provides a clear and detailed description of LangGraph, including its purpose, architecture, and key features. This directly aligns with the user's query about what LangGraph is, making the context highly relevant.

Score: 3/3

Criteria: Answer Relevance

Reasoning: The generated answer accurately describes LangGraph as a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs and mentions its foundation on LangChain. However, it introduces the term 'finite state machine approach' without context or explanation, which may not be directly relevant to the user's query. Overall, the answer is mostly relevant but slightly less comprehensive than the context.

Score: 3/3

Criteria: Groundedness

Reasoning: The generated answer is mostly grounded in the retrieved context, as it correctly identifies LangGraph's purpose and its relationship with LangChain. However, the mention of a 'finite state machine approach' is not explicitly supported by the retrieved context, which could lead to confusion. Therefore, while the answer is largely faithful to the context, the additional term introduces a slight disconnect.

Score: 2/3
