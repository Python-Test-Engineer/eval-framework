üèÜ RAG Evaluation:

Criteria: Context Relevance

Reasoning: The retrieved context provides a clear and detailed description of LangGraph, including its purpose, architecture, and key features. This directly aligns with the user's query about what LangGraph is, making the context highly relevant.

Score: 3/3

Criteria: Answer Relevance

Reasoning: The generated answer accurately describes LangGraph as a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs and mentions its foundation on LangChain. However, it introduces the term 'finite state machine approach' without further explanation, which may not be directly relevant to the user's query. Overall, it is mostly relevant but lacks some detail.

Score: 3/3

Criteria: Groundedness

Reasoning: The generated answer is mostly grounded in the retrieved context, as it correctly identifies LangGraph's purpose and its relationship with LangChain. However, the mention of a 'finite state machine approach' is not explicitly supported by the retrieved context, which focuses on graph-based architecture and state management. This slight deviation affects the groundedness score.

Score: 2/3
