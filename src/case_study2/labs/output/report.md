## Latest AI Agent frameworks in 2025
In 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities for developing intelligent, autonomous systems. Notable among these are LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and Eliza.

**LangChain** is a Python-based framework that enables developers to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It offers modular components for creating and managing workflows, integrated memory for stateful applications, and compatibility with multiple LLMs and APIs. This flexibility makes it ideal for projects requiring conversational AI, automated research assistants, and document analysis.

**LangGraph** extends LangChain by providing a graph-based architecture for managing stateful, branching processes. This design is particularly useful for applications that require complex workflows, such as interactive storytelling, multi-step chatbots, and strategic simulations.

**CrewAI** focuses on role-based agent orchestration, allowing developers to define specialized agents that collaborate on complex tasks. Its features include dynamic task planning, real-time performance monitoring, and orchestration of various agents as distinct workers. CrewAI is well-suited for project management simulations, healthcare coordination, and environmental impact assessments.
