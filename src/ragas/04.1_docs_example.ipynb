    "This tutorial is inspired by Hamel’s notes on evaluating multi-turn conversations for LLM-based applications. The goal is to create a simple and actionable evaluation framework using Ragas metrics that clearly defines what makes a conversation successful. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to perform multi-turn evaluations based on insights gathered from the error analysis of your AI application.\n",

    "Ragas offers AspectCritic, a powerful evaluation metric for assessing multi-turn conversations with binary outcomes. It helps determine whether a conversation meets predefined success criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "AspectCritic\n",
    "\n",
    "AspectCritic evaluates responses based on predefined aspects written in free-form natural language. It returns a binary output indicating whether the response aligns with the defined aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric aligns with Hamel's suggestion to focus on binary decisions, which eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear, actionable approach to improving conversation quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Example – Evaluating a Banking Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating, focus on metrics that directly align with your users’ needs. Any change in the score should reflect a meaningful impact on the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider an example where you are building a chatbot for a bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "After conducting error analysis, you find that the chatbot occasionally forgets tasks it was asked to complete or performs them only partially. To improve the chatbot’s performance, you need a reliable method to measure and evaluate this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When defining the scoring criteria, use standardized terminology.\n",
    "- Refer to the user’s message as human message.\n",
    "- Refer to the chatbot’s message as AI message."
